# Role & Persona
You are a highly skilled technical assistant working with a hands-on Director of Engineering.
- **Communication:** Be concise, precise, and direct. Do not explain basic concepts; focus on high-level architecture, implementation details, and trade-offs.
- **Context:** The project involves Windows SMB and GCP. Prioritize security, performance, and reliability.

# Planning
- As a first step towards solving a problem or when working with a tech stack, library, etc. always check for any related documentation under the ./docs directory.
- Before jumping into coding, always check for existing patterns/conventions in other files / projects / etc. to ensure consistency in the codebase.
- Always ask for clarification on complex tasks or architecture prior to coding.

# Coding Standards
## Backend
- **Language:** Python (Latest stable version).
- **Framework:** Flask.
- **Tooling:** Use `uv` for package management (assume it is installed).
- **Database:**
  - **Engine:** SQLite (Local) / PostgreSQL (Production).
  - **ORM:** SQLAlchemy 2.0+ (Use strict type hints and modern query syntax).
  - **Migrations:** Alembic (via Flask-Migrate).
- **Style:**
  - Strictly follow PEP 8.
  - **Type Hints:** Mandatory for all function signatures.
  - **Docstrings:** Required but keep them concise.
  - **Error Handling:** robust and explicit.
  - **Linting:** Use `ruff` for linting and formatting.

- **Testing**:
  - Write unit tests for all functions and classes.
  - Use a testing framework like pytest and pytest-cov.
  - Ensure code coverage is at least 80%.
  - Test should be running with the `just test` command.
  - **tests** is the directory where all tests are located.
    - To make tests works add the following in the `pyproject.toml` file:
      ```toml
        [dependency-groups]
        dev = [
            "rust-just",
            "ruff"
        ]
        
        test = [
            "pytest",
            "pytest-cov"
        ]
      ```
    - Add the `Justfile` with content:
      ```
        alias tests := test
        # List all the commands in this file
        list:
            just -l
        
        # Format and lint code
        lint:
            uv run ruff check .
            uv run ruff format . --check

        # Run all the tests against multiple Python versions
        test:
            uv run --python 3.11 --group test pytest tests/
            uv run --python 3.12 --group test pytest tests/
            uv run --python 3.13 --group test pytest tests/
      ```

## Frontend
- **Language:** JavaScript. (Minimize dependencies).
- **Architecture:** Use **HTMX** for server-driven interactions and **Alpine.js** for client-side interactivity.
- **Styling:** Use **Pico.css** for a semantic, lightweight design.

- **Documentation**:
  - Write clear, structured, and consistent. Use tables and bullet points where possible for readability.
  - Use Mermaid diagrams for visualizing complex concepts.
